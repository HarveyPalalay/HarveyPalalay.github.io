									<h2><a href="#">The Power of<br />
									DATA SCIENCE</a></h2>
									<p>Data science holds immense power in transforming individual health and public health by leveraging the potential of data-driven insights. In individual health, data science enables personalized medicine, allowing for precise diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies tailored to each individual's unique characteristics and needs. In public health, data science enables the analysis of population-level health data, identifying trends, patterns, and risk factors, which inform targeted interventions, policy decisions, and the overall improvement of population health outcomes. Through its innovative approaches, data science has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and shape a healthier future for individuals and communities alike.</p>

									<p>This project aims to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. The comparison will be based on their accuracies in predicting COVID-positive or COVID-negative cases using a provided dataset. The best-performing algorithm will then be selected to develop a COVID prediction system. The project involves steps such as data collection, preprocessing, splitting the data into training and testing sets, implementing and evaluating the algorithms, tuning their hyperparameters, and ultimately selecting the algorithm with the highest accuracy or best overall performance for the COVID prediction system.</p>

									<p>One major area of predictive modeling in data science is classification. Classification consists of trying to predict which class a particular sample from a population comes from. For example, if we are trying to predict if a particular patient will be re-hospitalized, the two possible classes are hospital (positive) and not-hospitalized (negative). The classification model then tries to predict if each patient will be hospitalized or not hospitalized. In other words, classification is simply trying to predict which bucket (predicted positive vs predicted negative) a particular sample from the population should be placed. In this project, I explored a few classifications metrics in Python's scikit-learn and wrote my own functions from scratch to understand the math behind a few of them.</p>

									<p>Diabetic patients' re-admission refers to the phenomenon where individuals with diabetes, who have previously been discharged from a healthcare facility, are readmitted to the same or a different healthcare facility within a specific period of time. Re-admission typically occurs due to complications or exacerbation of their diabetic condition. Reducing diabetic patients' re-admission rates requires a comprehensive approach which includes improving patient education and self-management support, coordination between healthcare providers, medication management, and effective discharge planning with appropriate follow-up care. By addressing these aspects, healthcare systems can strive to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance the overall quality of care for diabetic patients.</p>

									<p>Health insurance premiums refer to the amount of money individuals or employers pay on a regular basis to secure health insurance coverage for themselves, their families, or their employees. These premiums serve as a primary source of revenue for insurance companies, which use the funds to cover medical expenses and administrative costs. The cost of health insurance premiums has been a longstanding concern due to several factors, including the complexity of the healthcare system, the rising costs of medical care, and the structure of the insurance market. This project aims to build a model that will predict the health insurance premium.</p>

									<p>Birth rate is a demographic indicator and an essential component of population dynamics and is commonly used in demographic analysis, social planning, and policymaking. Birth rate analysis is critical for understanding population dynamics, predicting future trends, and formulating policies and interventions related to healthcare, education, infrastructure, and social welfare. It provides valuable insights into the demographic makeup of a population and helps societies make informed decisions for sustainable development and well-being. This project aims to analyze and visualize birth rates. </p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="https://geriatricnursing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Parkinsons-Featured.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. In this project, we will build a model that will accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual using XGBoost. XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification. </p>

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="https://healthjade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/heart-arrhythmia.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Detecting abnormal heart beats, also known as arrhythmias, is a crucial aspect of cardiovascular health monitoring. Abnormal heart beats refer to irregularities or disturbances in the normal rhythm of the heart's electrical activity. These irregularities can manifest as a faster or slower heart rate, skipped beats, or an irregular pattern of beats. Accurate detection of abnormal heart beats is essential as they can be indicative of underlying cardiac conditions or other health issues. Some arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, can increase the risk of stroke or other complications if left undetected and untreated. Therefore, early detection and monitoring of abnormal heart beats play a vital role in preventing potential cardiovascular problems and improving patient outcomes.In this project, we will train 3 neural networks (dense neural network, CNN, and LSTM) to predict heart arrythmias using ECG signal (continuous electrical measurement of the heart). </p>
